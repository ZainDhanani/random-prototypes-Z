## examples

This directory holds occasional notebooks (and hopefully needed supporting files) to aid testing of 
various methods. In theory these should be commented enough to be fairly self-explanatory, in practice 
please ask Will if you have questions.

To tame the madness, each example is given its own subfolder.

(File formats .fits* and .npy* are not supported in this directory to avoid accidentally dumping large 
intermediate datafiles into this folder)
